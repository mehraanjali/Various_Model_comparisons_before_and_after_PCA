# Dimensionality Reduction with PCA in Machine Learning

Description:

High-dimensional datasets often pose challenges to machine learning models, including increased computation time and the risk of overfitting. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction, which can mitigate these issues. This set of code explores the impact of PCA on various machine learning algorithms by assessing whether the accuracy of these algorithms improves when applied to datasets with reduced dimensions.
